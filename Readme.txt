-Description-
	-This tool is an automated tool to facilitate the cleanup process of a computer.

-Before running the tool-
	-Be sure to read the onscreen instructions carefully (Atleast on the first run). 
	-Be sure to run the tool as an administrator or it will not run. 
	-Do not try to run this tool on anything below Windows XP. It won't work.

-When running the tool-
	-It is wise to not reboot the computer until the process is done. Although the tool 
	 has a restore point feature and will start where you have left off it is better to 
	 close out of any programs that ask for a restart until fully done. (E.g. ADW Cleaner)
	-The tool will open tasks automatically but it is not fully automated, it still needs user input and there is a reason
	 for that. You do not want to delete random files without knowledge of it.
	-This tool does a lot but it is not perfect so please don't rely on this for everything and report bugs as necessary.

-How to run the tool-
	-Running the tool should be simple:
	1) Double click on the "Brainiacs Cleanup.exe".
	2) Select the extraction path and click on "Extract".
	3) The tool will now automatically open.
	4) Follow the onscreen prompts and either selecting "Y" to accept or "N" to deny.
	5) Once you reach the menu make a selection based on the options allowed.
	6) The options will adjust based on your selection and will show either "Yes" or "No"
	 depending on the tools you have selected to run.
	7) Once you have selected the optimal cleanup process type in "SC" and press "Enter" to start the cleanup process.
	8) Follow the onscreen prompts to complete the notes.
